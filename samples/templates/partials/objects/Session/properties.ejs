    COMMENT: CUSTOM PROPERTIES FOR Session OBJECT
    COMMENT: ====================================================================================
    
    PRIVATE preauthenticatedId: String
        PURPOSE: Tracks a session ID that may have been pre-authenticated
        WHY: Used to detect when a host-provided session ID can skip login
        DEFAULT: ""
    
    PRIVATE verified: Boolean
        PURPOSE: Tracks whether the session has been validated with the server
        WHY: Allows code to distinguish between a session that exists locally but hasn't been verified versus one confirmed by the server
        DEFAULT: false
