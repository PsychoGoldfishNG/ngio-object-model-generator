CLASS SessionStatus
    DESCRIPTION: Represents the current status of a client session (result of checkSession call)
    NAMESPACE: NewgroundsIO
    NOTE: This is a simple data model that does NOT extend BaseObject
    
    PURPOSE: This class is the result/response object returned by NGIO.checkSession().
    It provides a simple, easy-to-understand snapshot of the session state.
    
    WHY SEPARATE?: The actual Session object is complex and tracks many properties.
    SessionStatus simplifies this into just three properties and a status code, making
    it much easier for developers to understand the session state at a glance.
    
    RELATIONSHIP: SessionStatus is a SNAPSHOT of the session at one moment in time.
    It doesn't track changes - it's just what the status WAS when you called checkSession().
    The actual session data is in NGIO.appState.session (a Session object).
    
    ====================
    STATUS CONSTANTS
    ====================
    
    UNINITIALIZED = "uninitialized"
        PURPOSE: No session exists yet
        WHY: Initial state when app first loads
        WHAT TO DO: Call NGIO.checkSession() to create a session
    
    UNVERIFIED = "unverified"
        PURPOSE: Session exists but hasn't been verified with the server yet
        WHY: We have a session ID but haven't received verification from the server yet
        (This can occur before sending a request OR while waiting for the server response)
        WHAT TO DO: Call NGIO.checkSession() to verify with the server, or wait for any pending request to complete
    
    NOT_LOGGED_IN = "not-logged-in"
        PURPOSE: Session is valid but no user is logged in (guest session)
        WHY: User hasn't used the login feature yet
        WHAT TO DO: Call NGIO.openPassport() to open the login window
    
    WAITING_FOR_PASSPORT = "waiting-for-passport"
        PURPOSE: Login window is open, waiting for user to log in
        WHY: Passport window was opened but user hasn't finished logging in
        WHAT TO DO: Wait for user to finish. Call NGIO.checkSession() intermittently to see if status has changed
    
    LOGGED_IN = "logged-in"
        PURPOSE: User is fully logged in
        WHY: Session is valid AND user has authenticated
        WHAT TO DO: You're good to go! Proceed with gameplay
    
    LOGIN_CANCELLED = "login-cancelled"
        PURPOSE: User clicked "cancel" on the login form
        WHY: User started the login process but changed their mind
        WHAT TO DO: Session is destroyed. You can call NGIO.checkSession() to start a new one
    
    EXPIRED = "expired"
        PURPOSE: The session ID has expired on the server
        WHY: Sessions expire after inactivity (hours to days depending on settings)
        WHAT TO DO: Get a new session by calling NGIO.checkSession()
    
    ERROR = "error"
        PURPOSE: Something went wrong
        WHY: Network error, server error, invalid app ID, etc.
        WHAT TO DO: Check the error property for details. Might be temporary.
    
    ====================
    PUBLIC PROPERTIES
    ====================
    
    status: string = UNINITIALIZED
        PURPOSE: The current session status
        WHY: Tells the developer what state the session is in
        VALUES: Must be one of the status constants above
        USAGE: Check this value in an if/switch statement to decide what to do next
    
    user: NewgroundsIO.models.objects.User | null = null
        PURPOSE: The logged-in user (if status = LOGGED_IN), otherwise null
        WHY: Provides user info when needed
        CONTENTS WHEN SET: { id, name, supporter, url }
        WHEN NULL: In all other statuses (not logged in, error, etc.)
    
    error: NewgroundsIO.models.objects.Error | null = null
        PURPOSE: Error details (if status = ERROR), otherwise null
        WHY: Helps developer understand what went wrong
        CONTENTS WHEN SET: { code, message }
        CODE VALUES: Matches NewgroundsIO.Errors constants
        MESSAGE: Human-readable explanation
        WHEN NULL: In success states (LOGGED_IN) and transient states

    CONSTRUCTOR
    ====================
    
    CONSTRUCTOR()
        
        PURPOSE: Initialize the SessionStatus object with default values
        
        BEHAVIOR:
            COMMENT: Set initial values - uninitialized with no user or error
            SET this.status TO SessionStatus.UNINITIALIZED
            SET this.user TO null
            SET this.error TO null
    END CONSTRUCTOR

    TYPICAL USAGE EXAMPLE
    ====================
    
    COMMENT: Developer code might look like:
    COMMENT:
    COMMENT:   NGIO.checkSession(function(sessionStatus) {
    COMMENT:       SWITCH sessionStatus.status
    COMMENT:           CASE LOGGED_IN:
    COMMENT:               COMMENT: User is authenticated!
    COMMENT:               var userName = sessionStatus.user.name
    COMMENT:               startGame()
    COMMENT:           CASE NOT_LOGGED_IN:
    COMMENT:               COMMENT: Show login button
    COMMENT:               showLoginButton()
    COMMENT:           CASE WAITING_FOR_PASSPORT:
    COMMENT:               COMMENT: Tell user to complete login, offer a button to cancel login
    COMMENT:               showWaitingForUserMessage()
    COMMENT:           CASE ERROR:
    COMMENT:               COMMENT: Show error message to user
    COMMENT:               alert("Error: " + sessionStatus.error.message)
    COMMENT:           DEFAULT:
    COMMENT:               COMMENT: Waiting for session info to download
    COMMENT:               showWaitingForServerMessage()
    COMMENT:       END SWITCH
    COMMENT:   })
    
    ====================
    STATUS LIFECYCLE
    ====================
    
    COMMENT: Typical successful login flow:
    COMMENT: 1. App loads -> UNINITIALIZED
    COMMENT: 2. Call checkSession() -> creates session -> NOT_LOGGED_IN or UNVERIFIED
    COMMENT: 3. User clicks login -> passportIsOpen = true
    COMMENT: 4. Call checkSession() -> sees passport window -> WAITING_FOR_PASSPORT
    COMMENT: 5. User logs in -> server updates session
    COMMENT: 6. Call checkSession() -> server confirms -> LOGGED_IN
    COMMENT:
    COMMENT: Alternative outcomes:
    COMMENT: - User cancels login -> LOGIN_CANCELLED
    COMMENT: - Network error -> ERROR
    COMMENT: - Session expires -> EXPIRED
    
    ====================
    IMPORTANT NOTES
    ====================
    
    COMMENT: This object is READ-ONLY. Don't modify its properties after creation.
    COMMENT: It's a snapshot - creating a new SessionStatus won't affect the real session.
    COMMENT:
    COMMENT: The real session data is in: NGIO.appState.session (Session object)
    COMMENT: This is just: A simplified status report for easy understanding
